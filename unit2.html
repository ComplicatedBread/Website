<h2>1.6 Access issues</h2>
<p class= "marginp">Websites have to be made with accessiblity in mind to disabled people, so that they are able to comfortably use and understand the
    website. You can manage this by using a content management system that supports this such as Drupal or Wordpress. Visually management
    can be sorted by making sure that your website does not contain flashing images (for people with epilepsy), colours that are not used
    as indicators incase there are colour blind users (or add a colour option for the colourblind), make text larger and more obvious for
    the visually impaired or add sound indicator and make the website comepletely usable by keyboard alone.
