    <h2>1.1 IT in modern business</h2>
    <ul>
    <p class= "marginp">IT is massively used in modern times with various uses such as marketing via graphic design or storing information of orders.
        It is increadibly useful since it provides businesses with the means to promote their goods and also sell them for example online orders
        a customer can easily browse the companies goods on their website and find the information on the product at the same time, then be able
        to order it all on that website making it significantly easier for the customer and the business.</p>

    <h2>1.2 Methods, skills and resources needed to complete digital projects</h2>
    <p class= "marginp">To have a successful digital project you need the correct resources, if it's a digital art project for example you would need the right
        software to be able to make it, such as photoshop. You would also need to correct amount of planning and mock ups so you can't make mistakes.
        For any digital project you would need computer skills, so a basic understanding of how they work and of basic softwares like microsoft
        word since this will save time and effort if you already know how it all works. Github is also a useful tool for projects because it can host
        custom made websites and you can upload your code so it is saved online or can be viewed publically.
    </p>

    <h2>1.3 Making a website</h2>
    <p class= "marginp">To plan a project using IT for example a website, you need to plan it. To plan it you can draw a plan of the layout of the text and images
        etc. you can also use trello which provides a way to set out what you plan to do, what you are currently doing and what you have done. You
        can use it to display to others what your plans are. Research should also be conducted on what your website will look like etc.
    </p>
    <a href="https://trello.com/b/br2RSLNO/website">Trello</a>
    </p>
    <p class= "marginp">If I had more time I would added more to it such as fixing the gallery to show images without opening
        the image in a new tab, also neaten it up visually with more boxes. I would of also liked to of improved the writing by spending more time 
        writing it.</p>
    </ul>
    <h2>1.4 Risks to a project</h2>
    <p class= "marginp">Projects often have alot of chances to fail, failure can come about for several reasons. Time restraints are often a factor of failure
        since you have a limited time to complete the project, so some parts could end up being unfinished and count as a fail. Adequate planning 
        is also important and ties in with time management since if the project is planned correctly with the time limit in mind there is less room
         for errors to occur so it can equal a finished project by the deadline.</p>

    <h2>1.5 Selecting technology</h2>
    <p class= "marginp">Selecting technology will be based on your experience with certain softwares so that it is easy to use when making your projects and can be
        applied easily. It also should be based on what best fits the criteria that the project demands so doing online research and getting
        recommendations can help you find what fits best.
    </p>

    <h2>1.6 Chosen technology</h2>
    <p class= "marginp">The tools that were used for my website included visual studio code, Trello and Slack, 
        I was happy using all of these tools since I have had previous experience with Trello before the course, VSC is also rather easy to use for
        me I have not had many difficulties with it. Slack was also easy to use since I have used a similar app for a long time, it  helped me get
        in contact with others in my class and send information easily. I feel these were appropriate to use for the project due to my experience 
        with some of the tools and I had little difficulty. Github helped me out alot too since I would not have been able to allow other people to
        view my website without having to download all the files associated with it, it also provided a place to save my code and other needed assets
        for the website so I can view it on other PC's and to download my code etc. It also saves your progress so if any changes are made after the
        upload it will have to be uploaded again but it creates a catalogue of saves so if something goes wrong with the most recent version you can
        go back and get that previous version to fix what you broke, it also means you can view your progress over time.
    </p>

    <h2>1.7 Legal guidelines</h2>
    <p class= "marginp">Copyright issues can affect projects with the issue of getting a copyright claim. Using a companies created character or assets without credit
         to them can get you a copyright claim, another issue you can get is GDPR which is a european law to protect data and privacy. This law can 
         effect projects if a persons personal data is breached if it is used within the project. It came into effect on May 25th 2018 after being made
        on the 14th of April 2016 however the idea was brought up eight years ago in 2012. The law effects all EU country members including EEA members
        such as Norway and Iceland.

    <h2>2.1 Review use of IT tools</h2>
    <p class= "marginp">I would say that I am mostly happy with the outcome of my website because I accomplished customizing it to how I desired and learnt some new
        visual effects like making text glow. I found no reason to learn any other tools because I found VSC etc. to be very useful in making the
        website. Trello was also easy to use since I have used it alot in the past.
    </p>
    <h2>2.2 Were the tool appropriate?</h2>
    <p class= "marginp">I found that these tools were appropriate for the project, VSC is easy to read and understand, learning html and css files was an easy task to
        complete in my opinion, they easily linked to other apps and tools such as Slack

    </p>

    <h2>2.3 Improvements for the next project</h2>
    <p class= "marginp">The website could of been made more efficiently if there was more than one person
        working on it since more people can be assigned roles that they are good at so the website would be completed faster but also would be made
        better with a collective amount of peoples talents. Another way to of made it more efficiently would of been to plan it more since I went in
        with no plan in mind and played it out as I went, which could of caused set backs if I started something then found I could not complete it.
    </p>

    <h2>2.4Further improvements</h2>
    <p class= "marginp">Next time I would probably invest in getting at least one other team mates to help, since they may be stronger than me in certain aspect of
        the website creation so the project won't be as difficult to complete since I feel that I could not comply with the time limit. In relation
        to having a team mate I could of used Slack to communicate with them and send information like code back and forth.
    </p>

    <h2>2.5 Reviewed outcomes</h2>
    <p class= "marginp">To review the outcomes I ensured that my code was correctly used and meant that the pages were error free and worked as intended, I made sure
        that all of the content used for the website was prepared correctly and all saved in the right place for ease of access, I also chose
        techniques that I learnt to assure that clartity and navigation of the site was correct and I used this knowledge to see that all links are 
        accessible and work as intended giving access to outside sites and to other pages.
    </p>

    <h2>3.1 Benefits and drawbacks of IT tools</h2>
    <p class= "marginp">Using trello allowed me to set out what I needed to complete and what was finished so a check list of sorts. I also wish that VSC had a spell
        check option in terms of unerlining mispelt words so that I am aware of errorsin my spelling. Working in a team too would of definitely been
        more effective since the work load will of been divided up and also peoples indivisual skills could of been used.

    </p>

    <h2>3.2 Improvements on efficiency</h2>
    <p class= "marginp">Management of trello should of been better, such as applying more goals to reach in time. Also basic planning for the website itself in terms
        of it's design and layout of writing. I also should of preped for my codes layout.
    </p>

    <h2>3.3 What should I do differently next time</h2>
    <p class= "marginp">To improve what I should do next time I will code more effectively, such as using more functions or class selectors to reduce the amount of
        code I am writing and so I dont have to repeat writing the same thing over and over. I will also plan out the project fully with time gates
        on different parts of the project, visual planning of the design and more prep work. 
    </p>
    <h2>3.4 Testing digital solutions</h2>
    <p class= "marginp">To test my website I would go through a sort of check list to see that everything is adequate, firstly I would go through each page and check
        for gramatical errors, spelling mistakes etc. with the text since this is an easy fix but is quite noticeable. Afterwards I would check that
        all pages load correctly and render quickly without lag so the website can be accessed with haste. Next I would look for any issues with the
        graphic design of the website, such as whether the images are loading correctly or are displayed incorrectly and make any needed changes, also
        I would view how any drop downs work or in my case if the gallery is working as intended. I would go and click all links too to see that they
        take me to the correct page pr external site and fix any errors with them.
