    <h2>IT in modern business</h2>
    <ul>
    <p>IT is massively used in modern times with various uses such as marketing via graphic design or storing information of orders.
        It is increadibly useful since it provides businesses with the means to promote their goods and also sell them for example online orders
        a customer can easily browse the companies goods on their website and find the information on the product at the same time, then be able
        to order it all on that website making it significantly easier for the customer and the business.</p>

    <h2>Methods, skills and resources needed to complete digital projects</h2>
    <p>To have a successful digital project you need the correct resources, if it's a digital art project for example you would need the right
        software to be able to make it, such as photoshop. You would also need to correct amount of planning and mock ups so you can't make mistakes.
        For any digital project you would need computer skills, so a basic understanding of how they work and of basic softwares like microsoft
        word since this will save time and effort if you already know how it all works.</p>

    <h2>Making a website</h2>
    <p>To plan a project using IT for example a website, you need to plan it. To plan it you can draw a plan of the layout of the text and images
        etc. you can also use trello which provides a way to set out what you plan to do, what you are currently doing and what you have done. You
        can use it to display to others what your plans are.The tools that were used for my website included visual studio code, Trello and Slack, 
        I was happy using all of these tools since I have had previous experience with Trello before the course, VSC is also rather easy to use for
        me I have not had many difficulties with it. Slack was also easy to use since I have used a similar app for a long time, it  helped me get
        in contact with others in my class and send information easily. I feel these were appropriate to use for the project due to my experience 
        with some of the tools and I had little difficulty. The website could of been made more efficiently if there was more than one person
        working on it since more people can be assigned roles that they are good at so the website would be completed faster but also would be made
        better with a collective amount of peoples talents. Another way to of made it more efficiently would of been to plan it more since I went in
        with no plan in mind and played it out as I went, which could of caused set backs if I started something then found I could not complete it.
        Next time I would probably invest in getting at least one other team mates to help, since they may be stronger than me in certain aspect of
        the website creation so the project won't be as difficult to complete since I feel that I could not comply with the time limit. In relation
        to having a team mate I could of used Slack to communicate with them and send information like code back and forth.
    </p>

    <p>I would say that I am mostly happy with the outcome of my website because I accomplished customizing it to how I desired and learnt some new
        visual effects like making text glow. If I had more time I would added more to it such as fixing the gallery to show images without opening
        the image in a new tab, also neaten it up visually with more boxes. I would of also liked to of improved the writing by spending more time 
        writing it.</p>
    </ul>
    <h2>Risks to a project</h2>
    <p>Projects often have alot of chances to fail, failure can come about for several reasons. Time restraints are often a factor of failure
        since you have a limited time to complete the project, so some parts could end up being unfinished and count as a fail. Adequate planning 
        is also important and ties in with time management since if the project is planned correctly with the time limit in mind there is less room
         for errors to occur so it can equal a finished project by the deadline.</p>
    <h2>Legal guidelines</h2>
    <p>Copyright issues can affect projects with the issue of getting a copyright claim. Using a companies created character or assets without credit
         to them can get you a copyright claim, another issue you can get is GDPR which is a european law to protect data and privacy. This law can 
         effect projects if a persons personal data is breached if it is used within the project.</p>
